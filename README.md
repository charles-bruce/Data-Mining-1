## Spotify Tracks Analysis

### Authors: Bruce Charles Omogbolahan, Marco Palumbo, Kodjo Flaurent 

**Abstract**: This project analyzes the Spotify Tracks dataset, exploring 20 genres with data on track names, artists, albums, popularity, and audio features. It spans four tasks: Data Understanding and Preparation, Clustering Analysis, Classification, and Pattern Mining and Regression.

### Task Overview

- **Task 1: Data Understanding and Preparation**
  - Explore dataset variables, assess data quality, and prepare data by feature engineering.
- **Task 2: Clustering Analysis**
  - Apply clustering techniques (K-Means, DBSCAN, and more) to discover inherent groupings in the dataset.
- **Task 3: Classification**
  - Predict track characteristics using decision trees, KNN, and Naive Bayes, focusing on feature selection and model evaluation.
- **Task 4: Pattern Mining and Regression**
  - Extract frequent patterns, association rules, and perform regression analysis to predict continuous variables.

### Dataset

The Spotify Tracks dataset includes tracks' fundamental attributes and audio-derived features, offering a rich ground for data mining analysis.
